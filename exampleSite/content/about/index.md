Bugs Bunny, the famous, Oscar-winning cartoon rabbit, hosts his first weekly television series, along with all his fellow Warner Brothers cartoon stars, including Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, the Tasmanian Devil, Tweety Bird, Sylvester Cat, the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote, Pepe Le Pew, Foghorn Leghorn, and Speedy Gonzales. Each episode features three theatrical cartoons introduced by Bugs and/or the other characters, and often with a unifying idea, or theme. Many episodes feature Bugs as a lecturer on such subjects as cats, dogs, birds, and humans, and offering classic Warner Brothers cartoon footage to comically illustrate his points.

# That's all folks!
